PEPPERDHCP

Hi there! Welcome to the PepperDHCP repository!

To get you started with PepperDHCP, I have included this small readme with instructions,
basic usage information and other meaningful stuff.

Have a look at the files, and use the terminal to build them:

    $ make

You can then run PepperDHCP with the following command:
	
	# ./pepperdhcp
	
(.. that is, assuming you are root ..)

Or using this command, if you have sudo access and you are not root:
	
	$ sudo ./pepperdhcp
	
(.. if you have neither you should consider yourself unlucky, as PepperDHCP
only operates on ports lower than 1024 - or in laymen terms - it requires root access ..)



I'm sure you can take it from there. Go ahead and mess around with it, it should work by the time someone actually reads this!

Happy DHCP-serving!
